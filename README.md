# UFO-Sighting-Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to utilize Javascript to analyze data and to submit our visualizations via website using HTML+CSS. In this project, I am assisting Dana, a data journalist that wants to create an article about her hometown in McMinnville Oregon. Her hometown is famous for its UFO sightings that go back to the 1950's. Using a JavaScript array of UFO sightings, we must build a dynamic webpage to house a searchable table of our UFO sightings. 

## Results
We have created the webpage with our table of UFO data. With our filterable search, we can look up sightings by date, city, state, country, and UFO shape. 


1. In order to begin your search, you have to navigate down to the filter search section to the left of the displayed table.

2. After navigating to the filter search section, you may choose any number of filter options. It is not necessary to fill in each field for data to be displayed.

3. After inputting your filter options, you must press ENTER on your keyboard, or you may click any blank space on the webpage to have the corresponding data displayed on the table.

## Summary
In conclusion, we were able to create a fully dynamic webpage using HTML+CSS that displayed data extracted from a JavaScript array. After completion, our webpage serves the purpose it was created for, however there are some drawbacks and recommendations I would make note of. 

1. Our search data only includes instances from one source. To improve upon our search, I would recommend gathering more data, perhaps from a global database of UFO sightings. 

2. Although there are prefilled fields for our filters that display the format of how to search for data, this could be improved upon. A dropdown menu that shows a list of cities or states with available data could prove useful for searching. This way, as you type, you could see if your search would yield any results or not before finishing. 

3. Our search function does not have a button. In order to complete your search, you must either click whitespace on the site or click enter. It may be useful to create a button so that individuals searching do not accidentally search too early or lose their previous search without the intent to.
